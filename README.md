# What is this?
I have developed a food order app similar to Zomato and Swiggy. It features both user and admin panels, allowing restaurant owners to list their restaurants and users to order food from them. The app functions online, providing a seamless experience for discovering and ordering food. Users can browse various restaurant menus, place orders, and track their delivery status in real time.
